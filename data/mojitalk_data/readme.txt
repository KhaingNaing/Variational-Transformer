A datum is comprised with an original tweet, an responding tweet and an emoji label that indicated the emotion of the responding tweet.

The emoji and the original tweet together make up a line in a '.ori' file. Any emojis other than the first character of each line belong to the content of the original tweet.

The corresponding responding tweet is in the corresponding '.rep' file with the same line number.
